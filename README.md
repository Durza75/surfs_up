# Surfs up

## Overview of the Surf n' Shake Shop Analysis

### Purpose

I plan to start my own business in Oahu, Hawaii. The business will consist of a Surf n' Shake shop, where surfboards and ice cream will be sold to the locals.

W.Avy has expressed interest in investing in this venture but is concerned about the weather patterns of the area.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the previous weather patterns of Oahu by gathering data on year-round temperatures, especially comparing the summer temperatures with the winter temperatures, where there exists an increased probability of weather fluctuations. The temperatures for the months of June and December were sampled and analyzed.

## Results 

### Results of Surf n' Shake  

Three key differences were discovered during these two months and are listed below:

## Summary

### Summary and Recomendations

 Out of the three city types, urban cities are the most significant. They have the highest amount of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.  
 
 Based on the results of this project, the following three recommendations are given to the company.

 1. Review and implement a new pricing strategy of fare per ride in urban cities. 
 2. Increase the amount of drivers in urban cities to meet the high demand of riders. This can be done by incentivizing higher wages for urban drivers.
 3. Collect data on riders travelling from one city type to another.
